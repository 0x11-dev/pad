The idea is to provide "real time" updates on a given
search term.  Ideally, realTimeRecentChanges would be a
plugin to a "grand unified search" mechanism for EtherPad.

GUS would work in the following manner: it would support
some set of inputs (e.g. some tags and anti-tags, some
URLs, plain text, whatever), and provide some set of
outputs (e.g. JSON, RSS, HTML).

These inputs and outputs could then be wired together in a
web page.  Adding a plugin like realTimeRecentChanges
would change the way that web page works; in this
particular case, it would cause the outputs to be updated
in real time.

The pseudocode for realTimeRecentChanges is: 

  * do a JSON query at given intervals
  * transform the results into HTML
  * insert results in a tagBrowser-like page.

Note: This should modify the Tag Browser AND any other
search tools that derive from it, however, for the moment
I'm just going to demo it as an alternative version of the
Tag Browser.

MORE DETAILED FLOW DIAGRAM:

* the only hook provided is handlePath
* this is used to forward /ep/rtrc to rtrcBrowser
* rtrcBrowser.onRequest should do something (probably realTimeMatchingPads.start)?

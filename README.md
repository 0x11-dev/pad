# About EtherQuill

EtherQuill = [EtherPad](http://github.com/ether/pad) + [MathQuill](http://github.com/laughinghan/mathquill)

EtherPad is a web-based realtime collaborative document editor: [http://github.com/ether/pad](http://github.com/ether/pad)

MathQuill is a jQuery plugin that lets you type pretty math in your Web browser: [http://github.com/laughinghan/mathquill](http://github.com/laughinghan/mathquill)

EtherQuill is an effort to integrate the two, so that anyone with a Web browser who wants to collaborate on math homeworks and projects can type up beautifully kerned LaTeX-quality math.
